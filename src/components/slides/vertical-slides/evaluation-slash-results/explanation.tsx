A survey was conducted for two different groups to analyze whether the objectives were reached from the user perspective. 
          <br/>
• The first group consisted of three users who are classified as "experts" since they are proficient at conducting systematic literature reviews. 
        <br />
• The second group consisted of five "novice" users, all of whom have undergraduate degrees in engineering and currently doing their postgraduates.
