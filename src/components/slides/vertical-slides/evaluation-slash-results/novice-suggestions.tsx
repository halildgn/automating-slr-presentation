• Novice feedback was overall positive

• Having the ability to store the uniform query structure for future use didn't make sense from the perspective of novices

Explicit novice suggestions:

"Error message can be improved with more details. User has to understand step by step to avoid the error again."
<br/><br/>
"In the query generator, the fields are too wide, considering the text needed to input in them are not too long in general. Relation field, for example, takes the whole screen, while having only one word. By making the fields smaller, it can be easier to handle the addition of new fields."
