        <h3>Web-based GUI vs Native GUI</h3>
<p><small>
Research was conducted to decide on the front-end technology solution.
During their research in 2013, Jobe mentioned that for hardware-intensive
apps, using native apps was a better choice at the time of the writing, but the
applications that primarily consume content could be successfully replaced
with web apps nevertheless. It has been almost eleven years since the research
was conducted and nowadays web-based tools become so powerful that they
are not to be underestimated. Almost all apps use a hybrid native approach
right now, i.e. they either use a web engine of their own or directly use
the web engine of the underlying operating system to render a web-based
application.
