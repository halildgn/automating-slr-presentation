  <h4>
Possible reasons to employ a web-based GUI are:
</h4>
<p><small>
1. A web-based application can be deployed to the wider web, i.e. wider
audience reach. This can be done for both the frontend and the backend,
or it can be done separately, allowing people to use their own frontend
or backend if they choose to do so.
          <br/>
2. By far the most tool-rich ecosystem, as at the time of writing it is
the language on which the most development work has been done.
This would also make it easier for future possible contributors to join
the project since there are millions of resources to get help from the
biggest software community ever.
          <br/>
3. People are more used to using web-based interfaces as they spend most
of their time on them.
          <br/>
4. Web-based has the most backup options in case something goes wrong
during the research since all needed in the worst case is a web engine.
Due to the reasons listed above, the decision has been made to go forward
with a web-based solution.
