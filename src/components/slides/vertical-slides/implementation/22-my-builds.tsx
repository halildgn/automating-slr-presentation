The ”My Builds” component contains the saved builds of the user. These
builds are the uniform structures that are consumed by the application to
generate the queries for the digital libraries. The builds are also persisted and
if desired, can be used in the other computers like the browser bookmarks.
By enabling the users to keep the query structures for future use, productivity
should be boosted in the long term. The next section, Backend Architecture
elaborates more on the technical details.
