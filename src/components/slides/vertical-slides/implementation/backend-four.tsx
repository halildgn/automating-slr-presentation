          Payload Format
<br/><br/>
Compared to other formats, e.g. XML, JSON can provide better interoper-
ability with less effort and possibly cause less overhead. In addition to
that, due to JSON being much more human-readable and being the industry
standard for the web applications of our day, JSON was chosen as the payload
format of all transactions.
