Unwin and Hofmann tried to determine strengths and weaknesses of
command line interfaces and graphical user interfaces for a user when using
statistical software. They classified user in five potential groups and they discussed CLI or GUI fits better on the basis of four basic tasks for a
statistical software. They also reviewed the pontential for combining them.
They defined a good interface as the one that suits to user’s needs and
experience, and overall the interface should be helpful to the user.
