Kavakli et al. underline both the advantages and disadvantages of the
graphical user interfaces over command-line interfaces when coding the VR
systems. They first made the assumption that command-line interface
users had to either memorize the commands or look them up by consulting
the documentation. Graphical user interfaces though, provided an intuitive
user experience since they allowed graphical methods. During their research,
they measured the frequency of reaching the documentation for help in ”NO
GUI” vs ”GUI” applications. During the study, it was observed that GUI
users spent 14% of their total time on reading the documentation while this
went up to 25% while using the CLI. Some command-line interfaces provide
guidance while going through the application but we believe that intuitive
guidance via the visuals itself would be more productive.
