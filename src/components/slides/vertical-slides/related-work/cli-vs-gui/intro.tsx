Sampath defined a command line interface as a ”text-based interface”,
whereas Bernard characterized a graphical user interface as a ”type of
computer-human interface on a computer” and mentioned that it addresses
the blank screen problem that was challenging for the early computer users.
The discussion over command line interfaces and their graphical user interface
counterparts has been going on for some time since the introduction of
graphical user interfaces since command line interfaces have been among us
since the mid-1960s.
