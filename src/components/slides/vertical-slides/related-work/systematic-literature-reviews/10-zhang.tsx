Zhang tried to automate the systematic literature reviews by providing a
Python script that reads-from&feeds-into the standard-input&output via a command line interface. The interface consisted of two main functionalities,
query generation and filtering. The script provided a uniform interface that
generates boolean search queries for three digital libraries, WOS, ACM,
and IEEE-Explore. Filtering included filtering of the entries via inputting
values for certain parameters, and deduplication of the entries when no
parameter value is specified. It was mentioned in the conclusion section that
the script lacked a graphical user interface, and retrieval of resulting exports
from online digital libraries had to be done almost entirely manually.
