Chapman et al. conducted a research to see whether semi-automating
the manual literature search would result into a boost in the systematic
review efficiency. They compared what they call ”Scopus method”, the
a newly proposed manual search approach that uses Scopus database,
to a usual ”manual search approach” to figure how efficient it is. The
comparison is based on how valid the search resuts are and how long it took
them to perform the research. The Scopus-approach takes advantage of the
feature of Scopus that is, allowing users to export the whole reference list of
articles into bibliographic databases which contains all citations regarding a ”project” and can be created via special software, in their case they
made use of ENDNOTE. They used two databases which they called
”manual search database” and ”project database” respectively. They searched
Scopus database against the articles that they chose for manual search and
downloaded the reference list of each into the ”manual search database”.
They removed the duplicates there, and merged the ”manual search database”
with ”project database”, then discarded the duplicates, and print or export
new references right after. Lastly they carried out dual review of new citations
for references of interest. They determined that the Scopus-approach resulted
into a 62.5% time-saving. They observed no significant changes over validity.
