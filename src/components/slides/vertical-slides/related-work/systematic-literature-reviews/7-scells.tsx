Scells et al. explained how challanging of at task composing a boolean
search query is and how it is usually done by a highly trained information
specialist. They proposed a framework to automatically formulate
these boolean queries. They explained five steps of the frame work. Then
they discussed the automatic query formulation techniques that were used.
At the end, they made the conclusion that on there were no particular
automatic query formulation technique whose query perfomed better than
the ”simplified original query”. Beside this, they compared the impacts of
each five steps of the framwork and it was mentioned that the structure
of the query is more important than the keywords used for rapid review
oriented measures.
