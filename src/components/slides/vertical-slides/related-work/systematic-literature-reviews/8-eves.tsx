O’Mara-Eves et al. identified the lack of precision as the problem when
performing systematic searches. They proposed text mining as the
potential solution since the reviewer could save time if the screening process is
semi-automated. With the purpose of substituting a second human screener
with text mining, they employed classifiers to determine whether items
should be included or excluded, and these decisions were then compared
with those made by a human reviewer. They expected this method to be
highly attractive to the systematic review community because, although it
lessened the resources needed for screening items, all items retrieved through
searching would still be reviewed by a human screener. This could help
alleviate worries about automated screeners incorrectly identifying items as
false negatives.
