To explicitly automate the systematic review process, Marshall used
machine learning tools. They made use of the text classification and data
extraction methodologies of natural language processing. As an example of
the use of text classification techniques, they mention the ”abstract screening”
which is used to determine whether separate articles meet certain criteria
based on their abstracts. They use probability estimations to decide whether
the document should be included. These estimations are then used to order
the documents from the most to the least relevant. After the screening, data
relevant to the review is extracted and a risk of bias assessment is made.
